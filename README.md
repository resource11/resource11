Hello! I'm Kathleen and I'm a full stack engineer with a design background. In other words, I really enjoy the front of the frontend, digging into new technologies, and [talking about accessibility](https://noti.st/resource11), React component libraries, design systems, and inclusive documentation.

When Iâ€™m not [coding, designing, or speaking about things](https://kathleenmcmahon.dev), Iâ€™m the best Lanterne Rouge cyclocrosser youâ€™ll ever meet.
